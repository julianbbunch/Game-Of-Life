1) Using one thread in the first milestone, the average real runtime was 165 
	seconds. With two threads the average time 90 seconds. This is around a 45%
	increase in speed. 

2) Running the two instances of the timer at the same time the real runtime for
	each process is about 162 seconds each. That is 80% more time than running
	one at a time, roughly double. This is about what I would expect since for
	fairness sake, the Linux scheduler doesn't completely run and finish one
	instance of the timer before letting the other on the CPU. So, both get
	roughly evenly slowed down by each other. I think the real runtime is a bit 
	less than double because some parts the program don't use threads, like 
	allocating and freeing dynamic memory. By having two cores, the CPU can 
	run both single threaded sections of the process at the same time, and when 
	the two threaded sections come up, it will slow down to half speed since 
	there will be 4 threads and 2 cores. 
	
3) Compiling with the -O3 option sped up the real runtime to an average of
	29 seconds. This is around 67% faster than without the -O3 option.
